# split_api_key

This resource provides the ability to manage an [API key](https://docs.split.io/reference/api-keys-overview).

Due to API limitations, it is not possible update an existing API key. Any modifications to a `split_api_key` resource
will result in a destroy and recreate process.

-> **IMPORTANT!**
Please be very careful when deleting this resource as the deleted API keys are NOT recoverable and invalidated immediately.
Furthermore, this resource renders the actual API key plain-text in your state file.
Please ensure that your state file is properly secured and encrypted at rest.

## Example Usage

```hcl-terraform
data "split_workspace" "default" {
  name = "default"
}

resource "split_environment" "foobar" {
	workspace_id = data.split_workspace.default.id
	name = "staging"
	production = true
}

resource "split_api_key" "foobar" {
	workspace_id = data.split_workspace.default.id
	name = "my client side key"
	type = "client_side"
	environment_ids = [split_environment.foobar.id]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `workspace_id` - (Required) `<string>` The UUID of the workspace you want to create the environment in.
* `environment_ids` - (Required) `<list(string)>` List of environment UUIDs.
* `name` - (Required) `<boolean>` Name of the API key.
